# "packages available > 0" is NOT the signal that tells partial refresh from total failure: with

# (owfeed/owlab#18's own measurement, on the same shape of failure). What separates the two is the
# "N unavailable" count against how many feeds were CONFIGURED: N < configured means at least one
# feed answered and the rest of the index is usable; N == configured means none did. opkg prints no
# such summary line, so the same distinction is drawn by counting "Failed to download" lines against
# the configured feed count instead — opkg hits the identical shape (exit 1 with one bad feed of
# eight on 24.10.8, exit 7 with the network cut), so neither manager's own exit code decides this.
#
# Tolerating "some feed unreachable" must not tolerate OUR OWN feed being the one — without it
# there is no fresh package to install, so continuing means either installing nothing (a router

# from a prior run while printing "[+] Installed …" (security review, task 0176: `repo.owfeed.org`
# is a distinct host from the stock feeds, so an on-path/DNS attacker can blackhole it alone while

# on a stale index). Both managers print the FULL URL of a repository they could not reach in

# download <url>`), so grepping those lines for `$FEED_HOST` — the exact string this same script

# --- the catalogue for the language this router is set to ---------------------------------------

# that introduces the split, since the theme's own catalogue leaves with the old package.
#
# So: read the language LuCI is actually set to and fetch that one, best effort. A missing package
# is not a failure — most languages have no catalogue, and `en` never does. Nothing here runs when
# the router is on the default (unset, or `auto`, which means "follow the browser" and names no
# single catalogue to install).
#
# NOT IN THE FEED IS NOT THE END OF THE PATH. A release reaches owfeed-packages through a pull
# request against that repository, so a package that is NEW — which these two were, in 0.14.4 — is
# absent from the feed for as long as that takes, and every Russian router upgrading in that window
# would be told its language is unavailable while the signed asset for it sits in the release.
# So the release is the fallback, through the same verified chain the theme itself takes when the

	# "[+] Installed from the owfeed-packages feed" and `apk list -I` still said 0.12.5. That is the
	# shape of issues #16, #28 and #30: the installer reports success and changes nothing, and the
	# only way a user sees it is by reading the version in the Footstrap tab.

	# does not have the theme yet, so this one line covers both paths, exactly as the opkg leg below
	# already did with its explicit `opkg upgrade`.
	#
	# `<26`: apk resolves a bare name to the HIGHEST version across every configured repository, not
	# the one just added above — and this theme is now ALSO carried by the official openwrt/luci feed,
	# where luci.mk stamps the version from git's commit date instead of this project's own numbering
	# (measured on 25.12.4/apk-tools 3.0.5: `luci-theme-footstrap-26.246.70755~4fd72fd`, from
	# `feeds/luci/…`, next to owfeed's own `0.14.10-r1`). That stamp only grows with the calendar, so a
	# bare `apk add --upgrade "$PKG"` moves the router to the OTHER publisher's code — one that
	# predates this release, not an upgrade to it (field report: "Upgraded … -> 26.246.70755~4fd72fd").
	# `apk version -t` confirms `26.246.70755~4fd72fd` and `27.1.1~abc` both compare `>` against `26`,
	# while `0.14.10-r1`, `1.0.0-r1` and `25.99.99-r1` all compare `<` — so `<26` excludes every
	# LuCI-stamped build for good and still leaves this project's own numbering majors 1-25 to grow
	# into. DO NOT "tidy" this to `<1` — it would start rejecting this project's own future releases.
	# `--upgrade` with the constraint also REPAIRS a router that already took the official build: it
	# downgrades back to ours (measured: "Downgrading luci-theme-footstrap (26.246.70755~4fd72fd ->
	# 0.14.10-r1)"), which is why `--upgrade` stays rather than becoming a plain `add`.
