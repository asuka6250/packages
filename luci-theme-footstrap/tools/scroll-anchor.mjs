/* The reader's place, on an engine that will not keep it.
 *
 * A poll tick changes the height of things above the reader and the page below moves. Chromium,
 * Firefox and — since WebKit 26 — Safari all hide that with scroll anchoring of their own
 * (docs/anchoring.md, `ENGINE_ANCHORS`); an older WebKit and every iPhone before it had none, and a
 * current one can still get the COLLAPSE case wrong (task wkanchor, and the `tick` row below).
 *
 * The theme does that job where nobody else does (fs-fit.js, ENGINE_ANCHORS). This gate holds every
 * half of that sentence, since each can break silently:
 *
 *   held      with the engine's anchoring suppressed AND the theme's fallback forced on, a growth
 *             above the fold must move the reader by no more than a pixel or two.
 *   floor     the same refill with the correction switched off (`fsAnchor = 'off'`): the content
 *             column holds its height between ticks, so the document never gets short enough to be
 *             clamped. It can only be measured with the other half silent.
 *   swapped   a section refilled the way `dom.content()` refills one — emptied, then filled again —
 *             must leave the reader where they were too. The moment in between has no height, and
 *             `held` cannot see that: a growth only ever inserted never collapses anything.
 *   not twice with the engine's anchoring left alone, the same growth must move the reader just as
 *             little — a fallback that also ran there would throw the page the other way.
 *   quiet     while the reader is SCROLLING the theme must not correct at all: a correction landing
 *             inside a flick is itself a jump.
 *   tick      while the reader is PARKED and nothing is inserted, a REAL poll tick — the engine's own
 *             anchoring included — must not move the offset either. `held`/`swapped` close inside
 *             800ms and `quiet` discards a still 400ms; a correction landing between those windows
 *             (WebKit's own, measured 421ms) passed all three and is what this row exists to catch.
 *
 * The growth in `held`/`swapped`/`quiet` is inserted rather than waited for: a real tick depends on
 * what the router's radios are doing, and a gate that only fails when a station happens to join is
 * not a gate. `tick` is the one case that measures a real one anyway, for the fault only a real tick
 * can show.

 *                the shape a third-party app is most likely to emit. The leases are stable (32 and
 *                36 rows on the stands), which is what makes it a repeatable cell.
 *   processes    one table, a direct child of `#view`. The climb out of it used to land on the host
 *                and give up, so nothing held the reader at all, on every engine, while a gate that
 *                only opened the first shape passed throughout. It does not poll and its single
 *                block is taller than the page scrolls (6397px against 6108px on owrt2512), so it
 *                proves the CLIMB and never the swap.

 *                repeatable is not a gate. And the block this sweep swaps there is not the block
 *                its poll replaces: emptying the section `div` moved the reader 252px against a
 *                120px pad while the block itself measured the same height before and after
