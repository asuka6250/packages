/* The poll floor, asked the three questions no other gate asks: is it the RIGHT height, does it
 * ever come off, and does it come off IN TIME?
 *
 * `holdFloor()` in fs-fit.js pins `min-height` on the containers a poll empties, so the document
 * cannot get shorter under the reader while `dom.content()` refills them (docs/anchoring.md). Both
 * ways of getting that wrong ship as the same symptom — blank page — and neither is visible in a
 * file or on a page that is merely loaded:
 *
 *   TOO SHORT and the floor does not hold: `.cbi-section-descr` on /admin/network/dhcp measured
 *   115px against the 156px it stands at, because the span was taken to the last ELEMENT and that
 *   box ends in text. 41px the document may shrink during the tick the floor exists for.
 *
 *   TOO TALL, or never taken off, and the floor IS the blank page: a section emptied of its table
 *   kept 1299px of `min-height` for the life of the page, and the reader's tab started that far
 *   down (issue #41). A box qualifies for a floor through its CHILDREN, so emptying it takes it out
 *   of the sweep's selector, so a floor is found here by the inline `min-height` it IS. The 0.14.4
 *   shape marked each one with an attribute and was reverted with the rest of that release's
 *   anchoring; this gate outlived it.
 *
 * Both were shipped, four releases apart, and 0.14.3 had neither: it cleared every floor on every
 * tick and measured `offsetHeight` — correct, at 1550 style writes per 25 s of polling, each one a
 * scroll-anchoring suppression. This gate is what lets the cheaper shape stay: it holds it to the
 * old one's answer.
 *
 *   TOO LATE and it is the same blank page for as long as it stands. A tab switch writes
 *   `data-tab-active` and moves no node, so the sweep that takes the floor off has nothing to wake
 *   it: the pane the reader left kept 2432px of `min-height` on System -> Startup, and the tab they
 *   opened started below it — for one poll interval on a page that polls, and for the life of a
 *   page that does not (#75, forum posts 68 and 73). `min-height` beats the `height: 0` an inactive
 *   pane is collapsed with, which is why refusing to WRITE a floor there was never enough.
 *
 *   node tools/floor-contract.mjs [--only owrt2512] [--all] [--pages /admin/network/network,…]
