	 * it the 2020 colourway and two forum-reported fixes. The headroom is deliberate and small: a
	 * feature's worth of rules should fit without a gate edit, a redesign's should not. A raise wants
	 * a line saying what bought it — a palette is the one feature that cannot be cheaper, every
	 * token being declared per mode or the block does not fully apply.
	 *
	 * 125,795 B on 2026-08-27, down 1,051 B when the squeeze learned that `>` is a delimiter like
	 * `{` and `,`: 516 child combinators were carrying a space either side.
	 *
	 * 127,699 B on 2026-08-30, up 299 B for the Overview card restyle: the key/value dividers gone,
	 * the label demoted below the figure it introduces, the active interface head saying "up" in the
	 * status colour instead of a full-bleed accent fill, and the data tables one step tighter. All
	 * of it keyed on the SHAPE of a table rather than on the three cards the grid used to name, so a
	 * third-party include of the same shape gets it too.
	 *
	 * 128,027 B on 2026-09-04, up 38 B to stop the toggle switch painting ui.Checkbox's SECOND
	 * label. `render()` appends `label.cbi-tooltip-container` next to the switch whenever the option
	 * carries a tooltip (form.Flag.tooltip — luci-app-firewall's `masq` is where users met it), and
	 * a bare `.cbi-checkbox > label` gave that label the pill too: a dead grey switch where the hint
	 * icon belongs. `[for]` is the discriminator — the switch label has it, the tooltip label never
	 * does — and it is the cheapest one: measured, HEAD 127,989 B; `[for]` over the five rules 128,014
	 * (+25); the 8px `gap` that separates the icon from the switch 128,027 (+38 in all); the same fix
	 * written as `input[type="checkbox"] + ` 128,127 (+138). The head-room was 11 B, so no form of
	 * the fix fitted;
	 * the limit goes to 128,512 rather than to the exact number, or the next one-selector bug fix
	 * needs a gate edit of its own.
	 *
	 * 129,193 B on 2026-09-04, up 1,166 B for the fifth colourway, `forum` — the OpenWrt forum's
	 * own Discourse scheme (03-palettes.css). A palette is the one feature this budget's own note
	 * above says cannot be made cheaper: every token declared per mode, twice, or the block does
	 * not fully apply. Measured against `2020`, the closest precedent (2,379 B light + 1,106 B
	 * dark = 3,485 B raw before mangling): `forum`'s extra weight is the six sampled colours
	 * needing a moved-value AND a "measured X, now Y" comment each, in both modes, because none of
	 * the six cleared AA on the surface Discourse itself pairs them with. The limit goes to
	 * 129,700, 507 B of head-room, matching the margin this budget shipped with before.
	 *
	 * 129,309 B on 2026-09-04, up 116 B for the content-width axis (issue #44): 02-tokens.css's
	 * `--fs-content-max`/`--fs-content-min` pair and 03-palettes.css's per-mode override are
	 * cheap, but they are still declared twice for the same reason every other axis is. The limit
	 * stays at 129,700 — 391 B of head-room, down from the 507 the forum raise left, because
	 * nothing about THIS axis needed more. */
	/* 127,027 B on 2026-09-04, DOWN 2,166 B: the select's chevron stopped being an SVG data-URI. A
	 * URI cannot read var(), so the stroke colour had to be written into the string and the whole
	 * declaration was repeated per palette and per mode - ten copies of one glyph. Two gradient
	 * bands take their colour from --fs-dim at paint time, so there is one declaration for the whole
	 * theme and a new palette costs nothing for it. The limit follows the number DOWN rather than
	 * banking the room: a ratchet that keeps slack it did not earn is not a ratchet. 127,600 leaves
	 * the same ~500 B of head-room this budget has always run on. */
	/* 126,595 B on 2026-09-05, down 432 B: four components whose selectors could not join the
	 * text-input group's ring without changing what they match (a pseudo-element, the legacy
	 * `.cbi-select` shell, two `:focus-within` containers) stopped restating the same two
	 * declarations and share one body each for the plain and the invalid state. Bytes were the
	 * smaller half of it — nothing before this stopped someone changing the ring on `select` and

	 * palettes that declared --fs-accent-soft at the SAME 10% the default already carries stopped
	 * repeating it (the dark blocks at 14%/15% genuinely differ and stayed); 44 six-digit hexes
	 * that were three-digit; and -webkit-appearance, whose unprefixed form ships at Chrome 84 /
	 * Firefox 80 / Safari 15.4, all at or below this theme's floor. The mask prefixes were checked

	/* 126,481 B on 2026-09-05, up 1,689 B for the accessibility pass, measured file by file against

	/* The FLASH cost of the shipped modules, terser with top-level mangling: every module ships,
	 * whether or not a given page loads it. 86,737 B on 2026-08-27.
	 *
	 * This one goes UP whenever a module splits: 337 B when the Appearance axes moved to
	 * `fs-axes.js`, another 432 B when the search palette stopped being required on every page and
	 * its recents bookkeeping moved into the loader. Both are the same trade, and that was the
	 * trade: a second module costs its own prologue and its own export names, and it took 5.7 KB
	 * off what every page DOWNLOADS. Flash is the cheaper side — a JFFS2 or UBIFS overlay
	 * compresses it at about 0.39x, while uhttpd sends the wire bytes uncompressed at 1.0x, so a
	 * byte moved off the cold path is worth more than a byte added to flash. Earlier the same day
	 * it came down 2,567 B on the refactor
	 * described below — it shrinks flash as well as the wire, because the two upload flows and the
	 * three list axes each became one and four repeated messages became four constants. A raise
	 * wants a line saying what bought it.
	 *
	 * 87,905 B on 2026-08-29, up 305 B for three faults in how the reader's place is kept, all three
	 * on the engine no CI job looks at: the poll's put-off pass moved the page 58px under the reader
	 * on ImmortalWrt 24.10/WebKit and nothing was measuring it; the floor was rewritten on every
	 * container every tick, which is a scroll-anchoring suppression trigger — 1550 style writes per
	 * 25 s of polling, 75 of them carrying a value that had moved, now 45 and all real; and the floor
	 * was written on table boxes, where WebKit ignores `min-height` and the document lost 284px.
	 *
	 * 88,426 B on 2026-08-29, up 476 B for `watchThemeColor()`: the browser's own chrome — a mobile
	 * address bar, the Android task-switcher card, an installed PWA's title bar — painted white over
	 * a dark page, because the theme shipped no `<meta name="theme-color">` and a static one cannot
	 * follow a palette. One observer on :root covers all 25 axes; a call in each applier would have
	 * been the cheaper bytes and the more expensive rule.
	 *
	 * 88,701 B on 2026-08-30, up 219 B for `swapIn()`: the router's commit is wrapped in a view
	 * transition, so a navigation cross-fades where the browser has the API and cuts where it does
	 * not. The bytes are the feature — there is no CSS-only form of it, the animation has to be
	 * started from the one synchronous frame in the navigation. The 32 B ahead of it came in with
	 * `fix(fit): see a table that grew past its parent`, which raised no budget.
	 *
	 * 89,347 B on 2026-08-30, up 646 B for the companion-package seam. Three parts, measured
	 * separately: `fs-search` builds its result pool from its own index PLUS the functions on
	 * `window.__fsSearchSources`, and calls a row's `onTake()` when it is chosen (427 B, and the
	 * palette is lazy, so this half is flash only); the chrome requires whatever
	 * `footstrap.settings.plugin` names (205 B); `fs-menutree` exports raw node presence, which is
	 * what lets a plugin gate a command on the menu node carrying its ACL group (14 B). It buys
	 * section search and the `:` command line WITHOUT either shipping in the theme — the first
	 * consumer, `luci-app-footstrap-palette`, weighs 12,970 B and none of it is here.
	 *
	 * 89,522 B on 2026-08-31, up 122 B for the recents list keying rows instead of paths: the
	 * palette can recall a SECTION now, which had no key of its own and so left only the page it
	 * sits on in the list. 53 B in `fs-search` (resolve a recent row against the pool, not the
	 * index) and 69 B in `menu-footstrap-common` (`remember()` takes a key and is exported for the
	 * source that produced the row; `warmRecent()` warms the page half of one).
	 *
	 * 89,663 B on 2026-08-31, up 141 B: `putBack()` re-reads where the element actually landed, not
	 * only the offset. A write the page clamped short stops the element somewhere other than the top
	 * it was remembered at, and every later tick then corrects to a position nothing can reach — 12px
	 * and 52px of reader, webkit/Overview @390 top. Two rects on a layout the write has already
	 * forced; the third field the memo carries, `_rest.at`, is NOT written, and the sweep is green
	 * on all 18 cells of that axis without it.
	 *
	 * 89,691 B on 2026-08-31, up 28 B: `naturalHeight()` refuses a box with no height of its own, so
	 * the floor stops pinning a collapsed tab pane open — 893px of hidden pane on Network ->
	 * Interfaces, and the active pane's content that far down the page (issue #41). One rect field,
	 * on a rect the function already reads.
	 *
	 * 89,989 B on 2026-08-31, up 298 B: the Appearance tab names the translation package when the
	 * router has not got it — the other half of issue #41, since the catalogues are their own
	 * packages now and nothing else on a router can say which one is missing. `fs-appearance` is
	 * required on ONE page, so this is flash rather than a cold download.
	 *
	 * 90,149 B on 2026-09-01, up 160 B: a box the reader cannot see gives its floor back, so a tab
	 * pane stops carrying the height it had while it was open — 1265px of dead page on Network ->
	 * Interfaces, and the reader's tab starting below it (issue #41 again). The style the climb
	 * already resolves is kept rather than re-read, and the pass carries one more array.
	 *
	 * 90,690 B on 2026-09-01, up 541 B: the floor is measured to the end of the CONTENT and is given
	 * back when a container empties for good — 41px of floor missing under the reader on
	 * /admin/network/dhcp, 1299px of it holding blank page on Network -> Interfaces. Three parts, and
	 * `tools/floor-contract.mjs` measures each: a Range over the tail after the last element, the
	 * `data-fs-floor` mark that lets the sweep find a floor whose box has left the selector, and the
	 * one scheduled second pass, without which nothing revisits a page that has stopped mutating.
	 *
	 * 90,978 B on 2026-09-01, up 288 B: a table inside a box the APP scrolls is left as a table
	 * (docs/third-party-apps.md rule 9) — luci-app-filemanager's listing came out as cards on a
	 * 1280px screen with 1224px of column beside it. A walk from the table to the content root,
	 * asked once per decision.
	 *
	 * 90,861 B on 2026-09-01, DOWN 117 B, and the two halves are unrelated. `swapIn()` is gone with
	 * the view transition it started, which cost the reader up to 3,728 ms of the page they had
	 * navigated away from on WebKit (docs/spa-router.md); fs-fit spends most of it back on a third
	 * observer, for `data-tab-active` — a tab switch mutates no node, so nothing woke the sweep and
	 * the outgoing pane held its floor: 2432px of blank above System -> Startup's textarea, for the
	 * life of a page that does not poll.
	 *
	 * 90,922 B on 2026-09-02, up 61 B: the bar re-fits the moment an indicator pill arrives. The
	 * cluster is in the chrome, which the fit engine does not watch — `#view` and the dialog are its
	 * roots — so flexbox answered first and the whole page sat 91px lower for 708 ms until something
	 * else woke the pass (measured on WebKit at 390px, in the narrow sidebar bar). The observer that
	 * already watches `#indicators` for the rail's badge now calls the fit in the same pre-paint
	 * callback, on a childList record only: the poll pill rewrites its label every tick, and a fit
	 * per tick is the cost this file exists to refuse.
	 *
	 * 89,825 B on 2026-09-02, down 1,097 B: the anchoring in `fs-fit.js` is 0.14.3's again — one
	 * reference taken before the tick and put back after it, instead of the natural-height reader,
	 * the deferred empty sweep and the two late corrections 0.14.4-0.14.6 grew on top of it. What
	 * stays out of the revert is the floor's own bookkeeping: the climb off a table box, the
	 * `data-fs-floor` mark the sweep finds its own work by, and the tab-switch observer.
	 *
	 * 90,090 B on 2026-09-02, up 265 B, and almost all of it is the two sentences themselves: the
	 * Appearance page now says where saving is. Its tab is mounted inside the stock System form, so
	 * LuCI's own Save & Apply footer sits under a page it does not save, and readers took it for the
	 * button that stores what they had just changed (forum topic 251930). The alternative was
	 * cheaper in bytes and worse: the ones who misread it are the ones who never reach the Defaults
	 * section where the real button is. `fs-appearance.js` is NOT on the cold path — only the System
	 * page fetches it — so the download budget below does not move.
	 *
	 * 90,438 B on 2026-09-02, up another 348 B: the same page now also says what each of the three
	 * Defaults buttons does, one clause each, under the buttons themselves. Two of them are resets
	 * and all three read as "save"/"reset", so the row never said which state each lands in — asked
	 * outright on the forum (topic 251930, post 90: "what is the difference on 'reset to saved' and
	 * 'reset to default'?"). Help belongs at the control that raises the question, which is why this
	 * is three sentences at the buttons rather than a longer banner at the top. Still off the cold
	 * path, still 54.8 KB downloaded.
	 *
	 * 90,497 B on 2026-09-02, up 59 B: the three buttons are renamed. "default" named the router's
	 * look in "Save as default" and the theme's in "Reset to default", while the router's look also
	 * answered to "saved" — three names for two states, and the forum asked what the difference
	 * was (topic 251930, post 92). One word per state now: `router` and `built-in`. The rise is the
	 * longer labels plus the spacer that keeps the destructive reset off the save button's elbow;
	 * the CSS side paid for itself by dropping a margin rule that duplicated
	 * `.cbi-value-description`'s own.
	 *
	 * 90,519 B on 2026-09-04, up 22 B for the fifth colourway, `forum`, the companion raise to
	 * `cascadeCss` above: the picker's label entry in `fs-appearance.js` and the name added to
	 * `fs-axes.js`'s `PALETTES` array, on the flash side only — `fs-appearance.js` is a page
	 * module, so a cold visit that never opens Appearance still downloads none of it
	 * (`coldJs` does not move). The limit goes to 90,600, 81 B of head-room.
	 *
	 * 91,095 B on 2026-09-04, up 576 B for the content-width axis (issue #44), split across every
	 * file `fs-density` already touches: 255 B of it is `fs-prefs.js`'s `CONTENT_WIDTH` listAxis
	 * and `fs-chrome.js`'s `shellGeometry()` memo key, BOTH on the cold path (the shared budget
	 * below moves by exactly this much); the remaining 321 B is page-only — `fs-axes.js`'s
	 * snapshot/reset/default wiring and `fs-appearance.js`'s picker group. The limit goes to
	 * 91,200, 105 B of head-room. */

	 * (+0.4 KB), all loaded on every page. The fourth, `fs-overview.js` (+1.1 KB), is a page module
	 * and does not land here, which is why this number moves by less than the flash budget above.
	 * The meter annotation is the biggest single piece and is cold by construction: a stock Overview
